            <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅓ cup wheat germ</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>5 ⅓ tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <li>In a food processor or in a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, white flour, wheat germ or oats, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, and salt.</li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <li>Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the butter to the flour-mixture. Mix until the mixture has a sand-like consistency.</li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <li>Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, and add the buttermilk and eggs. Stir until the liquids are fully incorporated.</li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>    
                <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface with 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. Ladle the batter onto the surface to form 4 inch pancakes. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them over, and cook them on the other side for about 2 minutes.</li>
